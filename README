<p align="center">
From a single sentence, PsyDesign AI generates a comprehensive brand report, a unique logo with DALL-E 3, and an interactive brand persona powered by GPT-4o. This project demonstrates an end-to-end solution for automated brand creation, built on a high-performance FastAPI backend and a dynamic, responsive frontend.

## 🚀 Key Features

PsyDesign AI provides a complete, automated branding pipeline with the following features:

### 🧠 AI-Powered Brand Strategy Report
The platform leverages **GPT-4o** to generate a comprehensive **Brand Psychology Report** from a single user prompt. This report includes:
* **Brand Personality:** Defines the brand's archetype (e.g., The Hero, The Sage), tone of voice, and core values.
* **Visual Identity:** Suggests a live font pairing from Google Fonts, ready for web use.
* **Creative Assets:** Proposes multiple unique brand names and memorable slogans.
* **Narrative:** Crafts a compelling brand story and a ready-to-use social media bio.
* **Targeting:** Creates a detailed target audience persona with interests, demographics, and pain points.
* **Marketing Idea:** An initial, creative marketing campaign concept to kickstart strategy.

-----

### ✨ Instant Logo Generation with DALL-E 3
* **Contextual Visuals:** The system uses the `logo_concept_description` from the GPT-4o report to generate a highly relevant and detailed prompt for **DALL-E 3**.
* **High-Quality Output:** Generates HD quality (1024x1024) logos that are minimalist, iconic, and versatile.
* **Integrated Download:** Users can download the generated logo directly from the UI, facilitated by a secure image proxy endpoint.

-----

### 💬 Interactive Brand Persona
* **Chat with Your Brand:** After generation, users can interact with a GPT-4o powered AI persona that fully embodies the new brand's tone and personality.
* **Context-Aware & Safe:** The persona is instructed to only answer questions related to the generated brand identity and politely decline any off-topic queries.
* **Text-to-Speech:** Users can listen to the brand persona's responses, powered by OpenAI's **TTS-1-HD** model for high-fidelity audio.

-----

### 🌐 Robust & Scalable Platform
* **Multi-Language Support:** The entire interface and all AI-generated content can be produced in **English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Chinese, and Hindi**.
* **Persistent History:** All generated brand identities, including their reports and logos, are saved to a database via **SQLAlchemy ORM** and can be revisited, compared, or deleted.
* **Modern & Responsive UI:** A clean, intuitive interface built with a mobile-first approach ensures a seamless experience on any device.

## ⚙️ Architecture & Data Flow

The application follows a clean, decoupled architecture:

1.  **User Input:** A user submits a brand description via the frontend.
2.  **API Request & Validation:** The request hits a FastAPI endpoint. **Pydantic** automatically validates the incoming data for correctness.
3.  **GPT-4o Analysis:** The backend constructs a detailed, structured JSON prompt and sends it to the **GPT-4o** API. This generates the core Brand Psychology Report.
4.  **DALL-E 3 Logo Generation:** The `logo_concept_description` from the GPT-4o response is used to create a new, highly specific prompt for the **DALL-E 3** API, which returns a unique logo URL.
5.  **Database Persistence:** The complete brand report (JSON) and the logo URL are saved to the SQLite database as a new history item using **SQLAlchemy**.
6.  **Response to Client:** The backend sends the complete brand data (report and logo URL) back to the frontend.
7.  **Dynamic Rendering:** The frontend JavaScript parses the JSON and dynamically builds the entire results page, including the report, logo, font previews, and the interactive chat window.

## 🏁 Project Setup Guide

Follow these steps to run the full project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites
* **Python 3.10** or newer
* **Git**
* An **OpenAI API Key** with access to GPT-4o, DALL-E 3, and TTS models.

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/PsyDesign-AI.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/PsyDesign-AI.git)
cd PsyDesign-AI
````

### 3\. (Recommended) Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
# On macOS / Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4\. Install Dependencies

Create a file named `requirements.txt` in the project root with the following content:

```txt
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]
sqlalchemy
openai
httpx
jinja2
```

Then, run the installation command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5\. Configure API Key

Open the `app.py` file and replace the placeholder with your OpenAI API key in **line 20**:

```python
# In app.py
API_KEY = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY" 
```

> **Security Note:** For production, it is strongly recommended to load the API key from an environment variable or a secrets management service instead of hardcoding it.

### 6\. Run the Application

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

The server will start, and you can access the application.

### 7\. Open the App
